same as the 3sum in #15 I set an index and a left/right pointer
if sum is too high, decriment right pointer
if sum is too low, incriment left pointer
used closestSum as a cache to carry the closest value soo far.
should an exact sum be found return sum
otherwise return closestsum
setting closestsum to infinity garuntees that the first sum is always closer, requires Math.abs

time complexity O(n^2)
space complexity O(1)
