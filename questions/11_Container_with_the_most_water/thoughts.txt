This is one of the worst written leetcode quetions I have come across. Judging by their image, what they are really looking for is: a max area created by two numbers in the array with an assumed interval of width for each item in the array. Much simpler to solve! 

I used the method of two pointers placed at the beginning and end of the array as it is a *known maximum width value*. As the width decreases we can determine the maximum height between the two referenced pointers! I left plentiful notes for this one.
