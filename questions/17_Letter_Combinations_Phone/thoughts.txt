Manually defining dialMap is more efficient than dynamically generating it.
Recursively loops through possible letters for the current digit.
Moves forward (index + 1) while building the combination string.

Time Complexity: O(3ⁿ or 4ⁿ) (depends on the number of letters per digit).
Space Complexity: O(n) (depth of recursion stack).
